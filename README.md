# roblox-experience-opener

This Python script is designed to open a Roblox experience on the web. A Roblox experience is a game or virtual world that you can play in Roblox. The script uses a Python module called 'webbrowser' to open the Roblox experience in your default web browser.

When you run the script, it will ask you to enter the Universal ID of the Roblox experience you want to edit. The Universal ID is a unique identifier for each Roblox experience. Once you enter the Universal ID and hit Enter, the script will construct a URL for the Roblox experience using the ID you entered, and then it will open that URL in your default web browser.

So if you want to play a specific Roblox game or virtual world, you can use this script to quickly open it in your browser without having to search for it manually.
